## KDE Plasmoid Todo Square

This is an experimental way to keep track of your todo's! Instead of making a
list, you can pin your todo's on a square. How to _exactly_ use the square is up
to the user, but it is recommended to put easy tasks more to the left, tasks with
lower priorities to the top. So an easy, low priority task will be in the top left,
a hard and high priority will be in the bottom right. See the images below!

Supports:
* Adding and deleting an infinite amount of todos
* Copy todos to clipboard
* Rudimentary theme support
* Rudimentary configuration

### Install
Should be installable through the KDE Store
You can also copy this repository in ./local/share/plasma/plasmoids/

###
Usage:
* Add a todo by right-clicking anywhere on the square
* Delete a todo by dragging it to the trashbin

Here are some images. As you can see, you can place 'dots' aka todo's anywhere
on the screen. Drag items to the tiny garbage bin to delete.

So this task is not very critical or difficult; that why it is in the upper corner
and the color is a bit fading

This is a mediocre important todo

Oh no, this todo is important. Luckily not to hard to finish ;)

Here some images of other KDE standard themes 'air' and 'oxygen'
